# Ambient Intelligence and Sensing
## Environmental Intelligence : Technologies and Applications

### Goal
This practical work was intended to raise awareness and motivate students to design and develop smart environments taking advantage of the integration of physical and virtual sensors while working in emerging domains such as the Internet of Things or Smart Cities.

### Problem
For the design and development of an intelligent system capable of generating useful information in the context in which it is implemented. To do so, it was necessary to solve the following problem: 
> Implement a system capable of collecting and monitoring readings from physical and/or virtual sensors.

### Resolution Steps
As a first step, the group focused on sensing a given environment using one or more physical and/or virtual sensors. Then, in order to guarantee access to the collected data, means of communication were established between the set of sensors and a central component, a backend, where the data should be processed and processed. Finally, a frontend for data visualization was implemented.
