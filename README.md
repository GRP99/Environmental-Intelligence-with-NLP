# Environment Intelligence with Natural Language Processing Support
## Environmental Intelligence : Technologies and Applications

### Goal
This practical work was intended to sensitize and motivate students to design and apply Natural Language Processing techniques in the context of intelligent environments capable of recognizing and interpreting textual interactions.

### Problem
In this work, the groups incorporated a socket between two loggers to be used in the form of a chat. For each message sent, the system evaluates the predominant emotion in the text and displays it along with the message. The user can configure a set of automatic responses to common questions, which can appear as a suggestion to be edited before submitting.

When the chat ends, the system should present a summary of the conversation.
